# This file describes the keymaps that will be built by the GitHub Actions CI.
# Each keymap is an "artefact", whose name goes as follows:
#
#   `quacken_[variant]_[dual_keys]_[options]`
#
# - [variant] (required): specifies the keyboard variant the firmware is meant for
#   - flex (integrated rp2040 micro-controller, any version number)
#   - zero (promicro, you’ll have to update the `board` field to have your actual promicro board)
#
# - [dual_keys] (required): specifies the flavor of tap/hold keys used in the keympap
#   - `ez`: no dual keys, VERY simple config
#     (recommended for absolute beginners)
#   - `lt`: layer taps on thumb keys
#     (recommended for beginner/intermediate users)
#   - `hrm`: homerow-mods enabled and refactored thumb keys
#     (recommended for intermediate/advanced users)
#   - `vim`: same as `hrm`, but with two separate layers instead of `NavNum`:
#     - VimNav: Vim-like navigation layer (e.g. arrows on HJKL)
#     - NumRow: numbers on the homerow, shift+numbers on the top row
#     (recommended for advanced users and Vim addicts)
#
# - [options] (not required):
#   - `lefty`: space on the left thumb, backspace on the right thumb
#     (might increse the workload of the left thumb too much)
#   - `shift`: add shift as a pinky homerow-mod
#     (useful for shortcuts, NOT MEANT to type text)
#   - [layout]: change the underlying layout from qwerty to one of:
#     - `azerty`
#     - `ergol`
#     - ... probably more in the future
